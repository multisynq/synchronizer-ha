## Development

### Local vs Production Configuration

This addon supports two configuration modes:

#### Local Development Mode (Default)
- Builds the Docker image locally from the `Dockerfile`
- Uses the current `config.yaml` configuration 
- No need to fetch from Docker registry

#### Production Mode
- Pulls pre-built images from `ghcr.io/multisynq/{arch}-synchronizer-ha`
- Used for published addon versions

### Switching Between Modes

Use the provided script to switch configurations:

```bash
# Switch to local development mode (builds from Dockerfile)
./switch-config.sh local

# Switch to production mode (pulls from registry)
./switch-config.sh production

# Check current mode
./switch-config.sh
```

When developing locally, the addon will automatically build from your local `Dockerfile` without needing to fetch from the GitHub Container Registry.

## Manual Testing (Dev/Debug only)
```
docker build -f Dockerfile.test -t multisynq-synchronizer:test-with-bashio .
docker run --rm -e SYNQ_KEY="..." -e WALLET_ADDRESS="..." multisynq-synchronizer:test-with-bashio
